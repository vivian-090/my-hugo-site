I am a girl who really loves horse riding. I first rode a horse when I was seven, and in the eight years since then, I’ve learned the special feeling of trust between horses and people. To truly ride in harmony with a horse, you need to understand its personality, feelings, and needs. Every time I brush and feed my horse, I slowly build trust and connection with it.

I especially love the moment when we jump over obstacles. In that instant when we leap, it feels like all my passion and focus are captured in the air. It’s not only a cool experience, but also fills me with pride and joy. Each time the horse lands smoothly, I feel excited and proud.

But what I enjoy even more is the peaceful time spent with horses. After riding, I like to lead the horse and watch it quietly eating grass. With warm sunshine falling on us, time seems to slow down. At these moments, I gently pat its neck and feel its unique warmth and strength. To me, a horse is not just a partner in sports; it’s a friend who listens to my heart. Every quiet moment together is a pure and special connection with nature.

Horse riding brings me freedom, courage, and a love for life. I look forward to spending more wonderful moments with horses and sharing this joy with others who also dream about horses.
