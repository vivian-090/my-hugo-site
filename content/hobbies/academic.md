## 📚 My Academic Journey

Ever since I was a child, I have been a well-rounded and curious learner. I have always had a broad interest in different academic disciplines, constantly exploring various subjects with enthusiasm.

### 🌍 Multilingual Abilities
I am fluent in **three languages**:
- **Chinese (Mandarin)** 🇨🇳
- **English** 🇺🇸
- **Spanish** 🇪🇸

Being multilingual has given me a unique perspective on different cultures and ways of thinking, allowing me to communicate effectively in diverse environments.

### 🎓 University Plans
In college, I plan to **major in psychology** 🧠. I have always been fascinated by the human mind—how people think, feel, and behave. Studying psychology will help me gain deeper insights into human nature and enable me to support others in meaningful ways.

I believe that learning should never stop, and I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge in these fields.
